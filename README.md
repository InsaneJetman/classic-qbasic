### BALLPSET.BAS
A program that bounces a ball off the bottom and sides of the screen by using the PSET option with the graphics PUT statement.

### BALLXOR.BAS
A program that bounces a ball off the bottom and sides of the screen by using the XOR option with the graphics PUT statement.

### BAR.BAS
A program that turns input data into a bar chart.

### CAL.BAS
A program that prints a calendar for any month in any year from 1899 to 2099.

### CHECK.BAS
A checkbook-balancing program that sorts and prints a list of any deposits and withdrawals input by the user, then prints the final balance in the checking account.

### COLORS.BAS
A program showing all combinations of the 16 background colors and 3 foreground colors (distinct from the background) in the 2 color palettes available in screen mode 1.

### CRLF.BAS

### CUBE.BAS
A program that illustrates simple animation of a cube by using multiple screen pages in screen mode 7.

### EDPAT.BAS
A program that allows you to edit a pattern tile for use in a PAINT statement. With pattern tiles, you can fill any enclosed graphics area on the screen with a pattern.

### ENTAB.BAS
A program that compresses an ASCII file by replacing runs of spaces with tab characters.

### FILERR.BAS
A program that searches for a string of characters in an ASCII file. This program traps and handles common file-access errors such as the user's entering an invalid file name or leaving a drive door open.

### FLPT.BAS
A program that lets you examine the internal format used by BASIC to store single-precision numbers.

### HIDE.BAS
A program that lets you hide or display a file, thus controlling whether or not it appears when you use the DIR command from DOS to list the contents of the directory containing the file.

### INDEX.BAS
A file I/O program that builds and searches an index of record numbers from a random-access data file.

### MANDEL.BAS
A program that generates a fractal (a colorful graphic representation of the properties of certain real numbers) on the screen.

### PALETTE.BAS
A program that demonstrates how to give the illusion of movement by rotating the colors displayed by the color attributes from 1 to 15.

### PLOTTER.BAS
A simple line-sketching program that uses BASIC's DRAW statement.

### QLBDUMP.BAS
A program that allows you to get a listing of the PUBLIC code and data symbols in a QuickBASIC Quick library.

### SEARCH.BAS
A program that searches any disk file for a pattern and reports every byte position in the file where the pattern begins.

### SINEWAVE.BAS
A program that plots the graph of the sine-wave function for angle values from 0 to PI (3.14159265) radians.

### STRTONUM.BAS
A program that converts to a numeric value any number input as a string, after first filtering invalid numeric characters (such as commas) out of the string.

### TERMINAL.BAS
A program that turns your computer into a "dumb" terminal when used with a modem.

### TOKEN.BAS
A program that breaks an input string into a series of tokens (a string of characters delimited by blank spaces, tabs, or punctuation marks such as commas or semicolons).

### WHEREIS.BAS
A program that recursively searches through all directories on a disk for the file name input by the user. When WHEREIS finds the file, it prints the complete directory path to the file.
