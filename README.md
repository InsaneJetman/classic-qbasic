# Classic QBasic
Microsoft QBasic (Quick Beginners All purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is an IDE and interpreter for a variant of the BASIC programming language which is based on QuickBASIC.
It was shipped together with MS-DOS 5.0 and higher, as well as Windows 95, Windows NT 3.x, and Windows NT 4.0.

QBasic came complete with four pre-written example programs:

* [**Gorillas**](../QBasic/GORILLA.BAS) - an [artillery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_game) game
* [**Nibbles**](../QBasic/NIBBLES.BAS) - a classic [snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game
* [**Money Manager**](../QBasic/MONEY.BAS) - a personal finance manager
* [**RemLine**](../QBasic/REMLINE.BAS) - a line number removal utility

But there's more! Previous releases from Microsoft have included other example programs. Some noteable ones include:

* [**Nibbles (beta)**](../DOS_5.00.224/NIBBLES.BAS) - an early version of Nibbles with no levels, just more food
* [**Reversi**](../DOS_5.00.224/REVERSI.BAS) - [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi), the classic strategy board game
* [**Sorting Demo**](../QBasic/SORTDEMO.BAS) - a program that uses multicolored bars and sound to illustrate various sorting algorithms
* [**Torus**](../QB_4.5/TORUS.BAS) - a graphics demonstration program that draws a multicolored doughnut-shaped figure on the screen, then animates it by shifting colors in the palette

Microsoft also published a package called Game Shop which was a precursor to QBasic. It came complete with six pre-written example games:

* [**QBlocks**](../GameShop/QBLOCKS.BAS) - Fit the falling shapes into a row ([Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) clone).
* [**QBricks**](../GameShop/QBRICKS.BAS) - Break through the bricks ([Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) clone).
* [**QSpace**](../GameShop/QSPACE.BAS) - Defend space stations against enemy attack ([Missile Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command) clone).
* [**QShips**](../GameShop/QSHIPS.BAS) - Sink your opponent's ship ([artillery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_game) game).
* [**QMaze**](../GameShop/QMAZE.BAS) - Find your way through the maze before time runs out ([maze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_maze_video_games) game).
* [**QSynthesizer**](../GameShop/QSYNTH.BAS) - Record and play your own music.
