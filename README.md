# QB64
QB64 is a BASIC compiler for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, designed to be compatible with Microsoft QBasic and QuickBASIC.
It implements most QBasic statements, and can run many QBasic programs, including Microsoft's QBasic *Gorillas* and *Nibbles* games.

**Gorillas** - an [artillery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_game) game

**Nibbles** - a classic [snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game

The versions here have been updated to fix timing issues on modern hardware.
