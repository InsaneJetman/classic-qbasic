This file contains a complete list of all files and directories on the 
distribution disks provided with this product.    

==============================================================================
NOTE: Files on the distribution disks are compressed (indicated by a "$" in
the file extension) and must be decompressed before they are used.  The Setup
program on disk 1 unpacks files as it installs them. A separate file unpacking
utility (UNPACK.EXE) is provided for manual file decompression.  The following
table displays the compressed/uncompressed file extension mapping scheme:

   Compressed file extension:        Uncompressed file extension:
	    *.AS$               -             *.ASM
	    *.BA$               -             *.BAS
	    *.BI$               -             *.BI
	    *.C$$               -             *.C
	    *.CH$               -             *.CHT
	    *.CM$               -             *.COM
	    *.DA$               -             *.DAT
	    *.DE$               -             *.DEF

	    *.EX$               -             *.EXE
	    *.FO$               -             *.FON
	    *.FR$               -             *.FOR
	    *.HL$               -             *.HLP
	    *.IN$               -             *.INI
	    *.KE$               -             *.KEY
	    *.LI$               -             *.LIB
	    *.MA$               -             *.MAK
	    *.MD$               -             *.MDB
	    *.MX$               -             *.MXT
	    *.OB$               -             *.OBJ
	    *.PA$               -             *.PAS
	    *.PI$               -             *.PIF
	    *.PR$               -             *.PRE
	    *.PX$               -             *.PXT
	    *.QL$               -             *.QLB
	    *.SY$               -             *.SYS
                           
An example of using UNPACK.EXE to decompress a single file is as follows:

	    C> unpack a:pwb.hl$ c:\bc7\help\pwb.hlp

This will decompress the PWB.HL$ file from the distribution disk in drive a:
to the file PWB.HLP in the C:\BC7\HELP directory.
